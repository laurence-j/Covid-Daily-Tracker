# Covid-Daily-Tracker
Retrieves and displays data from  NZ COVID Tracer APIs. 


To complete this project I have utilised the skills learnt during the first half of 
the COMPSCI 335 course.

This included fetching information from web APIs as well as manipulating
the data retrieved from these APIs to create visual graphs using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). 

I was also able to use the javascript skills that I have picked up from the first two weeks of the
course to enable my website to only require a single .html file for navigation. I did this by utilising 
the javascript .display feature allowing each div to be separately viewed in different navigation 'tabs'. 
Furthermore, I was able to gather specific data from the web api endpoints which I have used for my reflection 
through utilising my knowledge of javascript's .forEach function which I have learnt from previous assignments.
This function allowed me to correctly navigate through the web API's dictionary layout so that I could display the
"keys" of the web api dictionary as "dates" within my timeline thus allowing my website to have a straight-forward
yet functional user-viewing experiencing. 

Lastly, I was able to use the skills I have developed from manipulating 
Scalable Vector Graphics to create a visual graph showing the latest COVID-19 new daily cases from the past 7 days 
shown under the "infographics" tab. Overall, this maintains the minimalistic yet informative theme which I had chosen 
for my website by keeping the data presented as simple and straight-forward as possible.
